<h1 align="center">EdgeTech Occlusion Mapper</h1>


  Occlusion Mapper lets you record that area around a Pan Tilt Zoom camera that is a blocked by something in the way, like a building or trees. It produces an array of Azimuth and Elevation values. This array provides what is the lowest possible elevation that can be used at a given azimuth.


  ## Running Things
  Occlusion Mapper is available as a Docker Image on Docker Hub. Unless you are looking on making modifications to the code, you can just use the Docker Image that is available there. The included [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file provides an example of how to use that file. 


  The [occlusion-mapper.env](./occlusion-mapper.env) file provides the set of environment variables that need to be set. Save a copy this file as `.env` and then modify it for your local install. You will probably need to change the Project & Device names, along with the IP address for the camera.


  ## Usage 
  
  Launch the container using Docker Compose: `docker compose up`

  If the container is running locally, navigate to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

  Otherwise, if the container is running on another machine, navigate to that IP address with port 5000. For example: `http://192.168.1.111:5000`

  This will bring up a rudimentary web interface that lets you control the camera and record different Azimuth/Elevation values. To map out the ooclusions around your camera:

  1. Starting at 0° azimuth, find the camera elevation where you begin to have a clear view of the sky in the middle of the screen. 
  1. Next hit the **Add Point** button to record this value. The Graph at the bottom of the screen should update with this value. 
  1. Move the camera to the right. If the center of the frame no longer lines up with where planes would begin to be visible, adjust the Elevation and then hit **Add Point**
  1. Continue this process until you have arrive back at 0° azimuth
    
  

### Built With

[![Python][python]][python-url]
[![Poetry][poetry]][poetry-url]
[![Docker][docker]][docker-url]


### Prerequisites

Running this repo requires that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization, [Poetry][poetry-url] for dependency management, and [Python 3.11.1][python-url] is the version we've been building with.

## Usage

Hit `Use this template` and `Create a new repository` to get started. Name it `edgetech-` plus whatever functionality you're adding. You'll also want to rename everything that says `template` in this repository with that name.

Please use `README_TEMPLATE.md` as a template for your own `README.md` file. You'll want to delete this `README.md` and rename the `README_TEMPLATE.md` to `README.md`.

Within the `template` directory, you should find several files: a `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, and `template_pub_sub.py`. These files are the core of the template and are required to build your own module, though you'll want to rename the `template_pub_sub.py` file to whatever your module is called.

`pyproject.toml` is generated by running `poetry init` as we recommend using [`poetry`][poetry-url] to manage dependencies.

Once the `pyproject.toml` has been created, use `poetry install` to generate the `poetry.lock` file. You'll want to run `poetry config virtualenvs.create false` and `poetry install --no-dev` before calling `poetry install`.

### BaseMQTTPubSub Child Class

The core module that is a python wrapper around interacting with MQTT system, heartbeats and tests. The `template_pub_sub.py` file includes examples of recommended usage of the `BaseMQTTPubSub` module and how to build a child class using it.

An outline of the basic functionality can be found below.

Inheriting `BaseMQTTPubSub`:

```python
from base_mqtt_pub_sub import BaseMQTTPubSub

class TemplatePubSub(BaseMQTTPubSub):
    def __init__(
        self: Any,
        ...
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
```

The use of `**kwargs` allows you to override any of the class parameters set in the `BaseMQTTPubSub` constructor.

In the constructor of the child class, it is recommended that you connect to the MQTT client and publish a message to the `/registration` topic upon successful connection.

```python
self.connect_client()
sleep(1)
self.publish_registration("Template Module Registration")
```

Every child class should include a `main()` function which includes a publishing to the `/heartbeat` channel to keep the connection alive and any subscriptions to other topics in the system. It should also include a `while True` loop to keep the main thread alive and flush all scheduled function calls.

```python
  def main(self: Any) -> None:
        schedule.every(10).seconds.do(
            self.publish_heartbeat, payload="Template Module Heartbeat"
        )

        self.add_subscribe_topic(self.example_topic, self._example_callback)

        ...

        while True:
            try:
                schedule.run_pending()
                sleep(0.001)

            except Exception as e:
                if self.debug:
                    print(e)
```

To call the child class see that the environment variables are passed via `docker-compose` and passed to the constructor. The `main()` function is then called.

```python
    template = TemplatePubSub(
        ...,
        mqtt_ip=os.environ.get("MQTT_IP"),
    )
    template.main()
```

### Docker

Examples of a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` can also be found in this repo. Adding whatever environment variables that your class needs should go into your `.env` file after renaming the `template.env` and paths/names will need to be adjusted as well. The `Dockerfile` should only require script name/path changes as well.

### Topic Names

Recommended topic names should follow the format specified below.

```python
f"{DEVICE}/{HOST_NAME}/{DATA_TYPE}/{CONTAINER_NAME}/{TYPE_LITERAL}"
```

Example:

```python
f"/AISonobuoy/{HOST_NAME}/AIS/edgetech-daisy/bytestring
```

## Roadmap
